# Tic Tac Toe Game
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, demonstrating different programming approaches such as object constructors, factory functions, the module pattern, and ES6 classes.

__Overview__
The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three consecutive markers.

__Features__
Two-player turn-based gameplay.
Visual display of the game board.
Win detection to determine the game outcome.
Reset functionality to start a new game.

### Implementation Details 
Object Constructors
The game logic is structured using object constructors (Player and GameBoard) to encapsulate player details and manage the state of the game board.

__Factory Functions__
Factory functions are employed to create instances of the game components (createPlayer and createGameBoard). These functions encapsulate the creation process and allow for flexible instantiation.

__Module Pattern__
The game is organized using the module pattern, with related functionality grouped into modules. This promotes encapsulation and separation of concerns.

__ES6 Classes__
The newer ES6 class syntax is utilized for creating game-related classes (Player and GameBoard), offering a more intuitive way to define object blueprints.

__Usage__
To play the Tic Tac Toe game:

1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their markers.
3. The game displays the winner or declares a tie when the game concludes.
4. Use the "New Game" button to reset and start a new game.

__Technologies Used__
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)

__Structure__
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

* index.html: Main HTML file containing the game interface.
* styles.css: CSS file for styling the game layout.
* main.js: JavaScript file containing game logic and interactions.


__Development Setup__
To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in a web browser.
